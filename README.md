# Fragment-based antibacterial drug design
fragment-based algorithm for the design of antibacterial compounds

# DONE
* 01 - fragments in known antibiotics (nitrofuran, fluoroquinolone, carbapenem)
* 02 - GDB fragments t-SNE (GDB1 thru 17; GDB11+17+known antibiotics)
* 03 - NG + SA train set venn diagram and NG + SA models on external val sets
* 04 - scatterplot with insets
* 05 - in silico control
* 11 - round6
* 15 - crem code polished
* 17 - fragments compared to rationales

# IN PROGRESS
* 06 - round1 pilot screen clean (need to run to verify)
* 07 - round2 (need to run to verify)
* 08 - round3 (need to run to verify)
* 09 - round4 (need to run to verify)
* 10 - round5 (need to run to verify)
* 12 - NG round1 (need to run to verify)
* 16 - crem and vae downselect

# TODO
* 13 - hit rate summary figure with fragments inset (and then change results path in #17 with all successful mols)

# ON DECK

* SAR?
