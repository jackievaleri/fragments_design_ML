# Fragment-based antibacterial drug design
fragment-based algorithm for the design of antibacterial compounds

# DONE
* 01 - fragments in known antibiotics (nitrofuran, fluoroquinolone, carbapenem)
* 02 - GDB fragments t-SNE (GDB1 thru 17; GDB11+17+known antibiotics)
* 03 - NG + SA train set venn diagram and NG + SA models on external val sets
* 04 - scatterplot with insets
* 05 - in silico control

# IN PROGRESS
* 06 - clean fragments pipeline
* 13 - NG round1
* 15 - crem code polished

# TODO
* 07 - pilot screen clean
* 08 - round2
* 09 - round3
* 10 - round4
* 11 - round5
* 12 - round6
* 14 - hit rate summary figure with fragments inset
* 16 - crem and vae downselect
* 17 - fragments compared to rationales

# ON DECK

* SAR?
